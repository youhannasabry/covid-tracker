## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `env.json`

You will need to create an env.json file in the server/config directory.<br>
You can replicate the env.example.json and rename it to run the project right away.

## Automatic Location

To see better the UI changes of the map and the project I added the ability to log the temperature for any country.<br>
If you'd like the location to be detected automatically, change automaticCountryDetection to true in client/config.js.
